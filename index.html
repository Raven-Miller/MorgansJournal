<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
  My name is Morgan Thompson. I investigate the paranormal in my hometown with
  my friends. <br />
  I am starting this journal as a sort of second brain. A place to dump things
  from investigations, my own thoughts, information I find, etc. My own personal
  blog and journal. <br />
  (My personal journal will be password protected. Just a little security
  precaution.) <br />
  This is a way to keep myself organized. Maybe I can have a whole index about
  all the things we’ve encountered. <br />
  There’s a lot to do, but I enjoy this kind of stuff.
