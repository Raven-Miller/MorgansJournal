            <h2>My Job</h2>
<p>Hi. So, I conduct a lot of investigations with my friends. We each have our own roles and things we excel at. I'm the planner and documentor. I do all of the &quot;boring techinical stuff&quot; (Edith's words, not mine). I plan where we go, document the data, take pictures, etc. I actually really enjoy it. It makes me feel like a scientist. Science is one of my favorite subjects in school, actually. I also really like math.</p>
<p>Anyway. June helps me collect the data with all of their equipment and I write it down. Alex helps me with that part. He's really good at organizing, and he's a pretty fast typer, too.<br>
I also take photos. I have a digital camera, becuase it's cooler than just a phone camera. Plus, you get a lot of weird interference in Thatcher Woods with a phone. I've gotten some pretty cool pictures over the years, though. Edith gets the physical evidence, if there is any. I think she just likes to take stuff and have souvenirs, but it does help the investigation, so I don't usually say anything. It has led to some interesting conversations with the police department, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, um. That's my job. Documenting everything and planning. I like it a lot, and it's nice that the others pitch in.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Morgan out.</p>
